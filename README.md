# E-Commerse-Webstie
I successfully developed an e-commerce website as part of a college solo project, driven by a comprehensive case study. The project aimed to address the collective goals of local shopkeepers who sought to enhance their market reach by establishing a unified online platform. The website was meticulously crafted using a blend of PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL Oracle Database technologies to create a seamless experience for three distinct user panels: administrators, customers, and traders.

Each of these distinct user groups had their dedicated login portals, providing a secure and personalized entry point into the platform. Administrators could access an exclusive administrative dashboard, affording them control over product listings, order management, and user accounts. Customers benefited from an intuitive customer login portal, enabling them to browse products, place orders, and manage their profiles. Traders, on the other hand, had access to a specialized portal tailored to their needs, allowing them to upload product listings, monitor sales, and maintain their trader profiles.

To ensure a robust and secure hosting environment, I leveraged XAMPP Server to establish a reliable local server setup. Furthermore, I integrated PayPal's API seamlessly into the platform to facilitate secure online payment transactions, offering customers a convenient and trusted payment gateway.

This project not only demonstrated my technical prowess but also showcased my ability to translate real-world business needs into a practical and efficient digital solution. It underscored my proficiency in web development, database management, and API integration while addressing the specific requirements of the local retail community seeking to expand their online presence.
